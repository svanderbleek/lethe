# Lethe

Forget your Facebook.

## Script and Service

Lethe is meant to be hosted on cloud infrastructure as a Node.js
service. It relies on CasperJS for browser automation. Users enter
Facebook credentials and can then choose automated actions to delete
Facebook data such as tagged photos, status updates, wall posts, etc.
